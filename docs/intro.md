# Getting Started

Welcome to BrainCellData!

This site is managed by the [Macosko
lab](https://macoskolab.com) at the [Broad
Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org) to accompany our recent manuscript - 
[The molecular cytoarchitecture of the adult mouse brain](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06818-7) as part of the [BICCN 2.0 Initiative](https://www.nature.com/collections/fgihbeccbd).

It is home to two comprehensive brain-wide datasets datasets:

1. A snRNA-seq (single-nuclei RNA-sequencing) atlas of 4,998 transcriptionally defined cell type clusters
2. A Slide-seq spatial spatial transcriptomics atlas of one mouse brain hemisphere, generated together with [Fei Chenâ€™s](https://www.insitubiology.org) lab.

For downloading the data, go to the [Downloads](../downloads) tab.

For exploring the data in the viewer, go to the [Viewer](https://www.braincelldata.org) application.

<!-- TODO mukund, add more if needed? -->
Information about the Viewer components, functionality, and architecture can be found in the following pages (navigate using navigation bar or use the links that appear below on this page).

## Viewer Overview

The Brain Cell Data viewer is a web application that allows users to view and
explore brain cell data. It is composed of three, interlinked tabs:

- [GeneExp](https://www.braincelldata.org/genex) allows users to plot the expression of one or two genes in the Slide-seq atlas.

- [SingleCell](https://www.braincelldata.org/singlecell) helps to identify clusters by gene-expression and gives searchable accompanying metadata.

- [CellSpatial](https://www.braincelldata.org/cellspatial) shows the spatial localization of the snRNA-seq cell types in the
Slide-seq dataset.

For detailed information about each tab of the viewer, see the respective
viewer subsections in the documentation.
